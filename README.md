# Sentiment Analysis

## This is a sentiment analysis model , implemented on twitter datasets .

In this project, two supervised learning algorithms,Logistic regression and Decision Trees were used on a twitter dataset(testing dataset) containing 17,197 tweets. Out of the two, Logistic Regression turned out to be more efficient than Decision Trees by a sufficient margin(11% - Bag-of-Words, 6%- TF-IDF) on the basis of their F1 scores. However both the feature extraction methods , Bag of Words and TF-IDF turned out to be quite equal in terms of efficiency although TF-IDF had a slightly greater F1 Score  for Logistic Regression. 

[Code is available in the SAforTwitter.py file and was implemented using Google Colab]
